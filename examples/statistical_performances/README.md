# Statistical performances

In this folder, we have all validation test of the inference part.
That mean all test that take a model, run it, and retrieve back the parameter of the model to be compared to the original one.


To be tested:
- overdamped Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics
- underdamped Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics
- generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics

With biaised simulation : (transition path sampling/ umbrella sampling / metadynamics)
- overdamped double well
- underdamped double well


For all examples, we want to compare results of the various estimator as a function of the timestep and the number of data points.
